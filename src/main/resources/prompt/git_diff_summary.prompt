Analyze the provided git diff output and generate structured commit messages with EXACT formatting as specified in these rules:
1.Format according to Conventional Commits specification:
types(Scope):<Short description>
[BREAKING CHANGE: if applicable]
Common types: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, test
Scope: 2-5 word module name (e.g. "auth", "dashboard")
Short_description: Start with imperative verb ("Add" not "Added") and keep description under 50 characters
2.Group similar changes (e.g., multiple UI fixes) into single commits
3.Maximum 5 distinct commits, ordered by importance
4.Output format: one commit message per line. You MUST separate each commit with a newline character (plain text line break). Do NOT use markdown list symbols (e.g. "1." "2." or "-"). Output plain text only.
Provide just the formatted commit messages (no explanations) based on the code changes in the diff.
